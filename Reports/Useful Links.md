# LSTM v.s. GRU
This blog says nothing but one:
No obvious winner between LSTM and GRU

https://medium.com/paper-club/grus-vs-lstms-e9d8e2484848

But, these guys say GRU is simpler than LSTM and needs less memeory, which also trains faster with similar performance.

And, this guy says why GRU is faster.
